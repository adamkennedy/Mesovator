# Mesovator - 

A 4-hour implementation of an elevator control system

# Preamble

The project is tasked as follows:

    The challenge is intended to help us evaluate your problem solving and development skills.
    Our recommended approach is to develop a working bare-minimum framework, and then expand
    on your ideas in the time remaining. It is better to have a solution that runs but is 50%
    complete, rather than one that doesn't run and is 99% complete. 
    
    You have 4 hours to complete this challenge. Your time will start when you download the
    challenge (click the link) and ends when you mail the results back to us (either as an
    attached archive or a link to a GitHub repository). You can start whenever you would like,
    but please allocate a 4 hour block of time to complete the challenge. 

Additional verbal guidance is provided as follows (paraphrased):

   The problem is related to elavator control systems. We are examinining both your development
   approach and your testing, documentation approach. Some of us were joking that it would be
   fun to see you do it in Perl.

# Metaconsiderations

This repository contains an implementation of an elevator control system, with treatment of the task as a completely serious real world effort but with an artificially contrained time limit for the implementation.

For the sake of maximum amusement to the Mesosphere development team, and in consideration of the speed-development nature of the problem, I shall endeavor to meet your expectations and complete the task (primarily) in Perl.
